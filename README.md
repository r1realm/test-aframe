# 3D e-Commerce React App

This project is written with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in integration with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) to build a 3D e-Commerce website where by using Oculus VR, user can interact with the products that are on sale and add them to cart. 

## Motivation 

This is the final project of our intensive Front-End Bootcamp (Factoria F5) where as aspiring Full-Stack developers, we are trying to build a 3D e-commerce website. In this project, we have put into practise all the new methods, concepts and ideas learnt within these 3 months. 

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. 


### Tech/framework used
React, A-Frame

### Features
The aim of this project was to create an immerisve 3D e-commerce web. We used React and A-Frame models build the project which was challenging enough to implement (code-wise speaking) because the A-Frame model is written in pure HTML syntax and not in React.  

### Installation

To get started, in the project directory, you need to run some Local Installation:

`$ npm install --save aframe aframe-react react react-dom`
> To install the aframe, aframe-react and react-dom.

`$ npm install aframe-particle-system-component`
> These installations will help build virtual reality experiences with A-Frame and React.

`$ npm start`
> Runs the app in the development mode.\ Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

`$ npm install super-hands`
> To install the movement effect within the scene.

`$ npm install aframe-event-set-component`
> To install the interactions within 3D scene.

### How to use?

### Credits
The first and foremost credit we would like to give is to our instructor Carlos, who not only was there for us to help in this project but also believed that we could make it this far. Also, Factoria F5 community, for providing us this safe space to learn and grow as a person and in the profession that we are diving into.
