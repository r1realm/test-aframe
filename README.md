# 3D e-Commerce React App

This project is written with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in integration with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) to build a 3D e-Commerce website where by using Oculus VR, user can interact with the products that are on sale and add them to cart. 

# Motivation

### Credits
The first and foremost credit we would like to give is to our instructor Carlos, who not only was there for us to help in this project but also believed that we could make it this far. Also, Factoria F5 community, for providing us this safe space to learn and grow as a person and in the profession that we are diving into. And special thanks to Lola, for her motivating words and the push she gave in order for us not to give up in the end.
